            <h2>> Hello World.</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Surrplexie (Kai) and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a focus on Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing, and Security Analysis. My areas of interest specifically are, Reverse Engineering, Exploit Development, Detection Engineering, Malware Analysis, and Digital Forensics. I'm currently pursuing a certificate program in IT Computer Support Specialist and will likely continue to an associate's degree in IT Information Systems Security Specialist to continue gaining technical skills and cybersecurity concepts necessary for school and work related. I enjoy doing labs and projects for completing challenges, such as solving Capture the Flag (CTF) puzzles, and gaining hands-on experience through labs and real-world applications. I actively engage with the latest cybersecurity tools and continuously work to expand my skill set. As I progress, I document my certifications, special CTF's/Labs, achievements, and completed projects on my website to showcase my growing skills and expertise, as well to make a portfolio for potential employers. My academic journey includes pursuing a certificate program in IT Computer Support Specialist from MATC (GPA: 3.0/4.0). I have developed practical experience with a range of cybersecurity tools, including Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, Oracle VirtualBox, security analysis, and IDA, and am proficient in hardware assembly, system troubleshooting, and system analysis. I am currently seeking opportunities for internships or full-time positions in Cybersecurity, Security Analysis, or IT Support, where I can apply my technical skills, contribute to real-world security projects, and continue growing in the field. You can view my current skills and progress on my website at [mywebsite.com] or contact me at [xyz@gmail.com]
